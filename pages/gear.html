      <p>Now some of you are probably thinking what I was thinking when I started,
      and that is, "Well what gear should I get?" I will give you my suggested gear,
      and I will also give you some ideas for budget gear.</p>

        <h2>Cameras</h2>

    </div>

    <div id="thirdSection">

        <p>I have a Canon 7D Mark I, it is a wonderful camera and takes great pictures.
          All the bird pictures you saw on the previous page were taken with that camera.
          The 7D price range is $300-$400 used, and is completely worth it. Another camera
          I would suggest is a 5D, I have not personally used one but they have very good
          feedback. Their price range is in the $200-$350 range. The 6D is also highly
          rated, they sell for around the same as the 7D. There are of course more expensive
          options, but these get you started. I do not have very much knowledge in <thead>
            world of Nikon, but they are nice as well.</p>

      <h2>Lenses</h2>

    </div>

    <div id="sixthSection">

      <p>Just as important as your camera is your lens. I use a Tamron Generation One
        150-600mm, which I love. Lenses is were the pricing gets high for the right one.
        If you could afford it, I would say get the Canon 600mm lens, it is extremely nice.
        The Tamrons come in a close second, with a bit lesser construction. and Sigmas in a third.
        The prices for a Canon 600mm is anywhere from $2,500-$5,000. You can get a Generation 2
        Tamron brand new for about $1,000, or a Generation 1 for $500-$600. Sigmas are from $700 used
        to $2,000 brand new. I prefer the Tamrons because the are lighter then the Canons, and built better
        than the Sigmas. If you can not afford those you can shop around for a nice 400mm of those brands.</p>

        <h2>Binoculars</h2>

    </div>

    <div id="eighthSection">

      <p>I use Steiner binoculars, they have been great. You can pick up a pair on
        Ebay for anywhere between $100 and $500. This paragraph will be short and
        sweet due to my lack of knowledge of binoculars other then Steiner. You can shop around
        and see what you think, and find what you like.</p>

      <h2>Field Guides</h2>

    </div>

    <div id="tenthSection">

      <p>Last, but not least, field guides. I stated earlier that I prefered Ted
        Floyds guide, which is the best one I have come across. Another good one
        is Stan Tekiela's line of state-by-state field guides, which I find very
        effecient. The only downfall to Tekelia's books is that he only included
        the commonly seen birds in it.</p>

      <h2>Budget Gear</h2>

    </div>

    <div id="thirteenthSection">

      <p>My sister uses a Canon 20D and has gotten some amazing shots, I would suggest
        that camera if you are on a budget. 20Ds generally go for $40-$70 and give
        lots of bang for the buck. If you can't afford a large lens, she used a Canon 250mm
        lens and it worked great.</p>
