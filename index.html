      <h2>1. Field Guide</h2>

    </div>

    <div id="fifthSection">

      <p>A good field guide is essential, I prefer Ted Floyd's "Birds of North America"
        but there are others. A field guide is best used with the following methods:
        take note of color, size (as bigger than a robin smaller than crow etc. etc.),
        and build, such as crests, body shape, bill, and tail. Observe the bird,
        watch it for a while, note its flight, or whether it is catching bugs
        on the wing or scrounging around in the dirt. Once you gather enough knowledge
        of your subject then start flipping through the pages.</p>

      <h2>2. Optics</h2>

    </div>

    <div id="seventhSection">

      <p>Your optics can be binoculars, monocolurs, or a camera. They can even
        be the naked eye. It all depends on how serious you are about birding.
        Some people have just binoculars, some have binoculars and a camera. It
        is all based off of personal preference.</p>

      <h2>3. Clothes</h2>

    </div>

    <div id="ninthSection">

      <p>You may think that clothing has nothing to do with birding, but you
        would be surprised if you did. Birds are more likely to stay for you to
        observe them if you don't wear loud clothes (such as hot pink), this is
        optional really, but your success rate will be higher if you wear more
        natural colors such as brown, or gray.</p>
